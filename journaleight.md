##### **My Journal** 8

###### Today we created tables and input in those tables and I'd have to say I enjoyed it a little bit. Even though i dont know much about it at this point i would like to learn more about creating tables. On a side note keeping my sanity is a bit tough because of my transit to and from school. Just trying to maintain sleep and energy is becoming a bit tougher. I know i will be just fine I have dealt with hours like this fro the last 8 years at a minimum. I cant wait to go back tomorrow just to listen in on the next lecture. I do think I have a passion for this because i look forward to the next day. Note to self: Keep up the hard work, it will all pay off.
