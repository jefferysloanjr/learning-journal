###### Today we got situated with out groups and i feel pretty confident about our project. The team I am a part of is very smart. I need to actually get my bus mall code function so I have some sort of valuable code. I am nervous for the 301 entrance exam. I really hope I pass it. I am not comfortable with test and I feel i dont do as well on them the first time. I hope it all goes well.
