###### Today was nice to have some time to finish up some of the earlier weeks assignments and do resubmissions. Also during the lunch and learn it was nice to see a career position from others who are out there working daily and getting there perspective. I have a lot going on this weekend with family being in town and the entrance exam to 301, which honestly terrifies me. I have never really been good at test taking so we shall see how this goes. I hope and pray I make it.
