###### Today we learned about charts. I read up on charts since I was not present for class. It seems a bit complex. I feel of course I can get it but I may need a bit of help. I hope I haven't fallen too far behind since being sick. Tomorrow I should be there I am starting to feel better. I do not want to miss any more becuase I feel I was just starting to get the hang of things then I got sick and missed a couple of classes. I hope I can figure it out and I'm sure I can. Can't wait to go back tomorrow it'll fee good.
