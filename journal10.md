###### Fridays class was really rough for me. I had a hard time concentrating due to being sick. I have to leave early Thursday and Friday but still staying on top of everything. I am looking forward to finishing the chocolate pizza. Looks like a fun project that has a lot of challenges. Hopefully Monday i am fully refreshed.
