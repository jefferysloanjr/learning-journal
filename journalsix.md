###### Today I struggled a bit with trying to get all the math correct to average some of the objects. after a long walk to the ferry I realized how to do it. After that it all sort of just flew by and came to me easier then I hit a wall again. I am getting the concepts of these but slow. Sometimes I feel others get it before me and im behind a little bit but once it clicks it just clicks. I know with time it will become faster but it makes me nervous. I hope I am at the pace of what normal should look like. Working with DOM is a bit tricky and I may need more time just to figure it out. Tomorrow I cant wait for becuase its something new to learn and i am truly enjoying this. I just hope I am right where I should be.
