###### Working on all this code is definitely getting the best of me. I just wish it would click and i could understand it. I realize that it takes time to get to that point but it is definitely tough. Today rewriting the salmon cookies i just cannot seem to comprehend it. I think i have a decent grasp to were i got now but i dont really know how to go beyond that. I think tomorrows lecture and going over it will be nice to see. I want to survive week two and i know i will but i want it to be over because of how much bad ive heard about it. Tomorrow is another day. I look forward to it.
