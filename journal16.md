###### Today, I definitely feel much better in terms of getting over the cold I had and getting my code to work properly. I had struggled with it for quite some time but it finally just kind of made more sense today. I feel more confident and do feel like I made a fair contribution today. Looking forward to tomorrow and working with the team and seeing it being built.
