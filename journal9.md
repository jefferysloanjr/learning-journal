###### Today I didnt feel well so I asked Brian if i could leave after lecture. Its been a bit of a rough day with not feeling good and maintaining the assignments. I did not feel totally comfortable with styling it. I could use more practice but i think i have a baseline. With time I will be find. Tomorrow should be fun. Im excited.
