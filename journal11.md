###### Today was another sick day that wasn't much fun. I want to get better as fast as possible to go back and learn but for today i will stick to the slack and youtube channel. I did the media demo and that was cool to see how to intergrate audio into our code. I will be waking up tomorrow I am hoping refreshed to make it to school. I need to be there I dont want to miss another day. I dont want to fall behind at all.
