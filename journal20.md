##### **My Journal** 20

###### Today was fun and had a lot fun finishing up our project. It was nice having people that were interested and invested time to watch and ask questions of our project. It was a fun but extremely challenging 201 course for me. I learned a lot and met a lot of new people. I cannot wait to get back at school so I can continue to build myself and relations with others.
