###### It was a fun stressful day getting everything to function as one. I am having fun with my team working on our code together. It feels good to get input even if its bad or good, its more of team building and building relationships with others with there own opinion. I am getting better i still feel i need a lot of work to get where i need to be. With time i'm sure.
