##### **My Journal**

###### The last 4 days of my life have been very eye opening. I am gaining a new skill and have such a great appreciation of it. Learning all this code I have just had a lot of fun with it while completely challenging myself. Today we have learned about functions. It was very fun and during the pairing I gained so much more knowledge. I was paired with Kevin Miller and he has some prior experience and he helped me clear some of the areas I really struggled with. I really want to do a good job, I cannot fail. When I lay in bed I just look forward to the next day because I am so excited to learn more. That's a feeling I have not felt in a while and I think it's because I have dreamt of a moment like this for years. I am having just a bit a of difficulty memorizing some of the js. I know I can get it down with time.
